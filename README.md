### Instructions on how to build/run your application
To build and run this React application, you can typically follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)**:
   Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your React application is located.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the project's dependencies (specified in `package.json`):

   npm install

4. **Build the Application**:
   If the project requires a build step, run the build command. The build process creates an optimized production-ready version of the application.

   npm run build
   
5. **Start the Development Server**:
   If you want to run the application in development mode, run the start command:

   npm start

6. **Access the Application**:
   Once the development server starts, you can access the application in a web browser at the specified URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

By following these steps anyone can successfully run and access the web application.

### A paragraph or two about what you are particularly proud of in your implementation, and why?

In the given implementation, there are several aspects to be proud of:

1. **Modular and Readable Code**: The code is well-structured and modular, making it easy to understand and maintain. Each component has a clear purpose, and functions are named descriptively, enhancing code readability.

2. **Efficient Form Handling**: The `EditCustomerModal` component efficiently handles form submission and validation. The use of React hooks like `useState` and proper event handling through `onChange` and `onClick` functions streamlines the form's behavior.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**: The implementation provides a user-friendly interface for editing customer information. The form neatly displays customer details and validates essential fields, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

4. **Reusability and Extensibility**: The `Customers` component is designed to be reusable, allowing for easy integration into other parts of the application. The use of props enables customization and extension of functionalities as needed.

5. **Properly followed all the instructions**: Properly followed all the instructions provided in the readme file.

In summary, the implementation showcases good coding practices, effective use of React features, attention to user experience, and potential for scalability and further developmentâ€”all factors contributing to a robust and maintainable application.
